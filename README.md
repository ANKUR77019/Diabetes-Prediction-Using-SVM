# Diabetes Prediction Using SVM

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to predict whether a person has diabetes based on medical and health-related features. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used for binary classification.

The analysis and model implementation are done in a Jupyter Notebook using the PIMA Diabetes dataset.

---

## Dataset
The project uses the PIMA Diabetes dataset, which contains medical diagnostic measurements such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, insulin level, age, and other related attributes.

---

## Approach
The following steps are performed in this project:
- Loading and exploring the dataset
- Statistical analysis of features
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Train-test split with stratification
- Training a linear SVM classifier
- Evaluating model performance using accuracy score
- Making predictions on new input data

---

## Model Performance
- Training accuracy: ~78.6%
- Test accuracy: ~77.2%

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the `Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb` file
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially
